The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive framework for writing a quantitative article, consolidating all necessary components into a single folder. By organizing all writing and analysis in one place, this framework ensures that every part of the manuscript references the same data, allowing for streamlined analysis and a more efficient writing process.
