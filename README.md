# Academic Writing with Quarto :page_with_curl:

As a Social Science student, I often felt overwhelmed with organizing my class projects. This template aims to help with the process by keeping all files in a clean, organized file structure. If you ever struggled with streamlining your projects this might help you as well! 

The goal is to provide a comprehensive framework for writing a quantitative article, consolidating all necessary components into a single folder. By organizing all writing and analysis in one place, this framework ensures that every part of the manuscript references the same data, allowing for streamlined analysis and a more efficient writing process.

The structure and methods provided here are a consolidation of best practices and tools from multiple sources. Credit goes to these authors, which I cite in the respective files.
